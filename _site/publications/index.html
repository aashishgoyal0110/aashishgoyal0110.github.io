         We implement the Direction-Splitting solver originally proposed by Keating and Minev in 2013 and allow complex geometries to be described by a triangulation defined in STL files. We develop an algorithm that computes intersections and distances between the regular Cartesian grid and the surface triangulation using a ray-tracing method. We thoroughly validate the implementation on assorted flow configurations. Finally, we illustrate the scalability of our implementation on a test case of a steady flow through 144,327 spherical obstacles randomly distributed in a tri-periodic box at Re = 19.2. The grid comprises 6.8 billion cells and the computation runs on 6800 cores of a supercomputer in less than 48 h. -->

         Particle-resolved direct numerical flow solvers predominantly use a projection method to decouple the non-linear mass and momentum conservation equations. The computing performance of such solvers often decays beyond O(1000) cores due to the cost of solving at least one large three-dimensional pressure Poisson problem per time step. The parallelization may perform moderately well only or even poorly sometimes despite using an efficient algebraic multigrid preconditioner [1]. We present an accurate and scalable solver using a direction splitting algorithm [2] to transform all three-dimensional Poisson problems (and in particular the pressure Poisson problem) into a sequence of three one-dimensional Poisson sub-problems, thus improving its scalability up to multiple thousands of cores. We employ this algorithm to solve mass and momentum conservation equations in flows laden with fixed non-spherical rigid bodies. We consider the presence of rigid bodies on the (uniform or non-uniform) fixed Cartesian fluid grid by modifying the diffusion and divergence stencils on the impacted grid node near the rigid body boundary. Compared to [2], we use a higher-order interpolation scheme for the velocity field to maintain a second-order stress estimation on the particle boundary, resulting in more accurate dimensionless coefficients such as drag Cd and lift Cl. We also correct the interpolation scheme due to the presence of any nearby particle to maintain an acceptable accuracy, making the solver robust even when particles are densely packed in a sub-region of the computational domain. We present classical validation tests involving a single or multiple (up to O(1000)) rigid bodies and assess the robustness, accuracy and computing speed of the solver. We further show that the Direction Splitting solver is ~ 5 times faster on 5120 cores than our solver [1] based on a classical projection method [3]. -->

         The Direction Splitting algorithm is a computational method that facilitates the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation by decomposing a multi-dimensional Poisson equation into a series of one-dimensional equations. This approach allows for efficient and scalable numerical computations. The incorporation of rigid bodies in the computational domain is made possible by modifying the diffusion and divergence stencils near the fluid-solid interface. In our recent study [1], we implemented stencil corrections for fixed non-spherical rigid bodies and demonstrated the scalability and accuracy of the DS algorithm for a wide range of test cases. This study presents an extension of the Direction Splitting solver to effectively compute the dynamics of moving non-spherical rigid bodies in the presence of fluid flow. The interaction between rigid bodies and fluid can be categorized as either one-way or two-way coupled. The stencils resolving the fluid-sloid interface are updated at every time-iteration to account for changes in particle position and orientation. We demonstrate that the adaptation of the diffusion and divergence stencil in [1, 2] is inadequate for accurately predicting the dynamics of moving rigid bodies in a two-way coupled simulation, especially at O(102 ) Reynolds number. Hence, we implement a conservative cut-cell method for the discretization of the divergence term, and we also take into account the proximity of the fluid-solid interface in the advection discretization. The results of multiple test cases demonstrate that the suggested stencil modifications effectively capture the dynamics of fluid flow in the presence of freely moving rigid bodies. However, the cut-cell discretization of the divergence term constitutes a significant computing overhead that impacts the fast computing property of the Direction Splitting algorithm. -->

         We examine the modulations of the drag coefficient and lift coefficient on a spherical particle caused by the presence of a neighboring sphere when positioned in close proximity to a wall. Data are generated through the utilization of a fast and accurate Particle-Resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (PR-DNS) method that relies on the Direction-Splitting algorithm and that was extensively validated in our prior study. We further validate the method in the flow configuration of the present study by comparing them with data published in the literature. We consider three Reynolds numbers Re=20, Re=50 and Re=100, which describe the flow conditions in the vicinity of the wall. The primary sphere is positioned at a distance from the wall, while the neighboring sphere is positioned at a constant distance from the primary sphere encompassing all possible angular positions. We report the modulations of drag and lift compared to a situation without any neighboring sphere. The inclusion of a wall intensifies the influence of the neighboring sphere on the primary sphere and significantly modifies the values of drag and lift. We attempt to relate the values of the modulations of drag and lift to the modulations in the contours of the pressure and of the spanwise vorticity on the surface of the primary sphere. We take advantage of the periodic nature of drag and lift modulations as a function of the relative angular position of the neighboring sphere and propose a Fourier Predictive Model (FPM) to effectively represent the data using a finite number of modes in the cosine Fourier series. We show that our FPM is able to estimate the modulations of drag and lift excellently with a coefficient of determination 0.99 in the parameter space investigated in our study. -->

         We investigate the relaxation mechanism of a supercooled tetrahedral liquid at its limit of stability using isothermal isobaric (NPT) Monte Carlo simulations. In similarity with systems which are far from equilibrium but near the onset of jamming (O'Hern et al. in Phys Rev Lett 93:165702, 2004), we find that the relaxation is characterized by two time-scales: the decay of long-wavelength (slow) fluctuations of potential energy is controlled by the slope [∂(G/N)/∂𝜙] of the Gibbs free energy (G) at a unique value of per particle potential energy 𝜙=𝜙𝑚𝑖𝑑. The short-wavelength (fast) fluctuations are controlled by the bath temperature T. The relaxation of the supercooled liquid is initiated with a dynamical crossover after which the potential energy fluctuations are biased towards values progressively lesser than 𝜙𝑚𝑖𝑑. The dynamical crossover leads to the change of time-scale, i.e., the decay of long-wavelength potential energy fluctuations (intermediate stage of relaxation). Because of the condition [∂2(G/N)/∂𝜙2=0] at 𝜙 = 𝜙𝑚𝑖𝑑, the slope [∂(G/N)/∂𝜙] has a unique value and governs the intermediate stage of relaxation, which ends just after the crossover. In the subsequent stage, there is a relatively rapid crystallization due to lack of long-wavelength fluctuations and the instability at 𝜙𝑚𝑖𝑑, i.e., the condition that G decreases as configurations with potential energies lower than 𝜙𝑚𝑖𝑑 are accessed. The dynamical crossover point and the associated change in the time-scale of fluctuations is found to be consistent with the previous studies. -->
